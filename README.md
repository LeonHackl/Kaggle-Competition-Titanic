# Kaggle-Competition-Titanic

## Introduction

This is a basic take on the famouse titanic competition from Kaggle. In this notebook we'll tidy and visualize the data using matplotlib and seaborn before applying the most common machine learning algorithms including logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting and more. We're also going to use a roc-curve to visualize all the different models. The highest achieved accuracy on the submission is 80.86% (top 6%).
